<h2>Basic Info</h2>
<p>Orlando, Florida <br> Seminole State College student, animator, animation major, <em>future</em> UCF student, class of 2022</p>

<h2>More About Me</h2>
<p>I am a busy bee, working 5 classes at Seminole State, and I am spending almost all of my free time either working or working on my portfolio pieces for the portfolio review next spring at UCF. I am not very skilled in the field that i will be tested in, as i a do not draw or paint, so I am learning as much as I can now and will try my best to make my best work. That being said, I do not have any work that I can show now, but I certainly will by the end of this semester. </p>
